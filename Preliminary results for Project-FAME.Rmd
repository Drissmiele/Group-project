#Introduction.

Data provided by the following scientific article: **“Pest control of aphids on landscape complexity and natural enemy interactions”.** 
Data can be retrieved from: https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.n6428

Aphids are a major concern in agricultural crops, and control by natural enemies is an essential component of the ecological intensification of agriculture. 
This study used multiple natural enemy enclosures replicated in 18 fields of Brassica oleracea and other crop types across a gradient in landscape complexity to investigate;
the strength of natural pest control across landscapes, the contribution of natural enemy guilds to pest control and Interaction effect between natural enemy guilds and landscape. 

Variables studied:
Dependent:** Aphid Population Growth, Parasitism rate, Syrphid fractions, and the real final dependent variable which is final cabbage biomass. 
Independent:** Landscape complexity, exclusion treatments (a combination of one or more natural enemies)

**Interactions between variables**
-	Natural enemies aphid & population growth.
-	Aphid population growth & final cabbage biomass.
-	Natural enemies & parasitism rate.
-	Natural enemies & syrphid fraction.
-	Parasitism rate & aphid population growth. 
-	Syrphid fraction & aphid population growth. 
-	Relation between natural enemies & landscape complexity. 

# Objectives.

Our major objectives are to assess:

1.   The effect of natural enemies on aphid population growth across a gradient of landscape complexity.

2.   The individual and interacting effects of different natural enemy guilds on aphid population growth

3.   The possible interaction effect between natural enemy guilds and landscape complexity.

# Hypotheses.

1.	We will study whether the presence of natural enemies decrease aphid population growth, comparing plots with NE present to plots where NE is absent. In this case, the null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference in pop growth between plots when NE is present and NE is absent. 
2. We will study whether the combination of natural enemies have a complementary effect and not an antagonistic effect on aphid population growth. 
3.	We will study whether the effect of natural enemies is stronger in complex landscapes, comparing plots with complex landscapes to plots with simplified ones. 
4.	We will study whether there is an interaction effect between the type of NE and landscape complexity. According to the null hypothesis, the interaction may not be significant. If it is rejected, it would probably mean that we will see some guilds perform better in some landscape than others.
5.	We will study if the parasitism rate and syrphid fraction increases with landscape complexity or not. (H0; No differences in parasitism rate and syrphid fraction in complex landscapes )
6.	We will study whether aphid growth population decreases cabbage biomass (null hypothesis: no significant differences)

# Methods.
Step by Step:

- We checked for all the possible relationships between variables as highlighted in the introduction, 
- We looked for the best statistical method to see if they are significant. We used Linear models plus some Anova to do this
- Next we used the AIC Method to compare the models and check the interaction effect.
