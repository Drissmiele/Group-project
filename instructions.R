# Instructions for Submission
# Your Project. Preliminary results
# In this task you should include a document with all the preliminary analyses done in your project. 
# Please write your document in Rmarkdown format in a RStudio project folder.
# The project folder should have:
#   - The file “name-of-your-project.Rproj”. Which I will use to open it.
# - A file named “Preliminary-results.Rmd”. Which should render the document to evaluate. I will knit it to html (Please, be sure it knits correctly).
# - A folder “data” with all data files needed to run the .Rmd file.
# - A folder “R” to contain functions R scripts.
# - All other files and folders necessary to knit the “Preliminary-results.Rmd” document without errors.
# 
# Please compress the folder in a zip or 7z file and attach it to this task.
# Only one person from each group should send the document. This person will receive the answer.
# Please, put the title and all the team members names at the beginning of the document.
# 
# The document should have
# 1. Title.
# 2. Team members names.
# 3. Introduction. Explain the origin and structure of your data.
# 4. Objectives and hypotheses.
# 5. Methods. What have you done? And what did you use to do it? Step by step, so anyone could do it again by reading this part.
# 6. Results. Figures and tables with captions and description of what do they mean.
# # 7. Discussion. From your objectives.
# 8. Conclusions.
# 
# After this task, you will have to present your results to other students (and teachers), so you may want to start preparing a slides presentation, or at least saving the figures and tables that you find interesting to make it later. It is a good idea to save all figures automatically in a folder “results”.
"There are at least two errors which make I cant knit your Rmd document:
- There is not a .Rproj file to open the project.
- There is no data and therefore it gives an error from line 61 because it try to read a non existing Excel file.
Please fix it and send it again."
