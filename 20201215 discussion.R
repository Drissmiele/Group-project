#Aphids population growth
We excluded all the herbivores,flying insects and ground-dwellers, and in the treatment H aphids population growth was hightest of all Treatments.
This was followed by the HGD ( herbivore  and ground-dwellers), HP(herbivores and flying insects), HBP(herbivores + birds + flying insects (ground-dwellers excluded)), O(herbivores + all enemies) and HPGD(herbivores + flying insects + ground-dwellers (birds excluded).
